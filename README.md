# Chess Timer
This project is a chess timer built using an Arduino in their custom version of C++.

## What Does This Do?
This is used to track how much time Black and White have remaining in chess games.

## How Do I Use It?
Using the Arduino IDE, upload this code to your Arduino and you are set. Well, not actually. You need a 10 kohm petentiometer, an LCD, and many more components wired as shown in the image below.

## Wiring
Unfortunate I don't know how to write wiring diagrams so here's some pictures instead.
